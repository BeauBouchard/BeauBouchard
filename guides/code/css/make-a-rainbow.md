<p>A rainbow is arches, but how do you make an arch shape in CSS?</p>

<div align="center">
  <img src="/assets/media/images/guides/images/neatpartyoudont.jpg" />
</div>

<p>Render a circle and adding a shadow to it allows you to overlay two circles</p>

```css

```
<p class="spacers"> </p>

<div class="guide-5830-l05"></div>

<p>The drop shadow then renders a smaller circle behind of that one</p>

```css

```

<p class="spacers"> </p>

<div class="guide-5830-l06"></div>


<p class="spacers"> </p>

<p>then cut them in half by turning off overflow, and moving the object slightly down, so the bounding box of the object is off-center, only showing half of it. and . . . </p>

<p>Voil√† . . . AN ARCH</p>
