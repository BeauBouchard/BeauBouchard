# Add Code Coverage Tracking to your Repo with CodeCov

## Making a Github Action

As we previously have made a `.github/workflows/push.yml`, where it installs and tests code, we are creating a new task called `codecoverage` which will setup a new `ubuntu` environment, securly checkout he code, install npm and all the dependancies. 

The last two steps we are adding which are unique in this document are to use `jest` to generate a codecoverage output folder, which we then upload to CodeCov, a codecoverage SASS provider for tracking your codecoverage overtime for your repos. 

```yaml
  - name: CodeCoverage Generation . . .
    run: npm run test:coverage
  - name: Uploading to Codecov . . .
    uses: codecov/codecov-action@v2
    with:
      token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN}} # not required for public repos
      # fail_ci_if_error: true # optional (default = false)
      verbose: true # optional (default = false)
```

In this example here is what the `npm run test:coverage` includes in `package.json`:

```json
    "test:coverage": "jest --coverage | ./node_modules/.bin/codecov",
```


For instructions about setting up a codecov account, <a href="https://docs.codecov.com/docs">checkout this document on their site here</a>.  

Which all starts by setting up a repo with an <a href="https://about.codecov.io/sign-up/">account from github here</a>. 


## Github Action YAML Standalone

If you  want here is the previously mentioned steps we covered

```yaml
name: Default Node CI

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

jobs:
  codecoverage:
    name: codecoverage
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checking Out Commits Securely . . .
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - run: echo "üí° ${{ github.repository }} repo has been Cloned Successfully."
      - name: Setup Node 14 Environment . . .
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: 14
      - run: echo "üéâ Node 14 has been Installed Successfully."
      - name: Install Dependencies . . .
        working-directory: .
        run: npm ci
      - run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è Deps Installed Successfully. The workflow is now ready!"
      - name: CodeCoverage Generation . . .
        run: npm run test:coverage
      - name: Uploading to Codecov . . .
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v2
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN}} # not required for public repos
          # fail_ci_if_error: true # optional (default = false)
          verbose: true # optional (default = false)
```
