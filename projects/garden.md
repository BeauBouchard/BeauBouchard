    <p>Where a nutrient solution is continously pumped over the roots / growth medium of the plant, and drained off to rerecirculated again. This process saves overall amount of water by preventing a lot of evaporation and loss to the ground. It also allows the nutrient solution to be fully utilized.</p>
